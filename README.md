Introduction
============

This is a small proof of concept to see if Qooxdoo could be used for CATS as a UI framework. So it 
mimics the current CATS layout using Qooxdoo widgets.


How to get started
==================

Used go to the qx-cats directory and type:

    node-webkit ./
    
(or nw ./ based on your OS)    
    
Alternatively you can open the index.html file with your favourite browser.
